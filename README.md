# Hi, I’m Subere Houssein Ali

I’m a Software Engineering student at Western University with Advanced Entry Opportunity to Ivey (HBA path). I build at the intersection of software engineering, AI/ML, and capital markets.

## What I’m focused on
- Building reliable ML and data systems (pipelines, evaluation, edge cases)
- Developer tooling and product-minded engineering
- Quant and markets: research, backtesting prototypes, and structured diligence

## Experience
**Software Developer, DataAnnotation**  
Worked across Python and JavaScript projects supporting AI training workflows. Focused on data quality, logic validation, and catching issues before they scale.

**Computer Vision Engineer, Western Engineering Autopilot Team**  
Built Python pipelines to process camera inputs into structured outputs for real-time decision-making, working through messy data and performance constraints.

**VP Externals / Quant Dev, Western Quantitative**  
Led outreach and helped early technical initiatives for quant-focused projects and community building.

## Projects
**MealMakerAI** (Python, Flask, SQLite, JavaScript, Firebase)  
Full-stack app that recommends recipes based on fridge contents, with database integration and a working frontend-backend pipeline.

**Filament Roll Library** (Onshape, Web, QR tracking)  
Tracking system for filament inventory with workflow improvements and documentation.

## Tech
**Languages:** Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
**Tools:** Git/GitHub, AWS, Vercel, VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm

## Outside of code
Track and running, puzzles, chess, lifting, and building community.
